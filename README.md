# Implementing-and-Comparing-Facial-Recognition-Authentication-in-the-Nao-Robot

The Nao Robot has a tremendous ability to modernize and deliver fast and accurate results in everyday life applications. People who had worked with NAO robots know that the in-build cameras of NAO are not so good. Basically, our project is to create and compare algorithms that recognize the faces from the “not so good” images taken by NAO Robot with the help of pythons deep learning libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch. First, we take some pictures using the NAO’s built-in camera. Now, Using OpenCV’s different algorithms, we will try to detect the face on those images. We are going to build a model and use TensorFlow or PyTorch to train the model over time. Using this face recognition programs, one can program the Nao to take the class attendance. The robot will be able to recognize the faces of all the students and tell them when they're late. The Nao robot will improve class time management. This model has abilities beyond the classroom. It can be programmed to be used to check-in and check-out in hospitals, hotels, airports, work, and has a lot more abilities, power and applications.

# Weekly Progress 

# Week 1
The NAO is taking pictures through his build-in cameras.
The pictures taken by NAO robot are saved in the connected machine and are easily accessed.
Pictures can be captured by using either Choregraphe or by using self-made algorithim. Here, we found that images from the algorithim are better than the one from Choregraphe.
The algorithim, that is used here to take pictures from NAO robot is TakePicUsingNao.py
