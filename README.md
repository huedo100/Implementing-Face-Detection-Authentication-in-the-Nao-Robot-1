# Implementing The Face Detection Authentication in the Nao Robot

The NAO Robot a wide range of applications to automate many of our daily tasks. The NAO
robot has a built-in camera that can be used to recognize faces. Our project is to use NAO
robot to take the attendance for our classes. First, we will train NAO to learn the faces of
the students and save it in its memory. After the training, we will build a Blackboard
interface to take attendance using the NAO robot. This work will be based on the Python
programming language and Choregraphe software. Our application has the potential
beyond the classroom. Eventually, it could be programmed to use for check-in and check-
out in hospitals, hotels, airports, work, etc.

# Weekly Progress 

# Week 1
•	The NAO is taking pictures through its build-in cameras.

•	The pictures taken by NAO robot are saved in the connected machine and are easily accessed.

•	Pictures can be captured by using either Choregraphe or by using self-made algorithm. Here, we found that images from the algorithm are better than the one from Choregraphe.

•	The algorithm, that is used here to take pictures from NAO robot is TakePicUsingNao.py
